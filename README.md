# Module Project: U Vote It/UDEVELOPIT
In this module, you'll build the back end for U Vote It, a voting application for a local developer meetup group called U Develop It. In addition to building the Express.js API, which you already know how to create, you'll connect the back end to a relational database using MySQL.
